# Camino — TODO / status tracker

Living list of what we're tracking against. Update as work moves. Newest context at top.
See `HANDOFF.md` for the fuller picture and `core/SOURCING.md` for obligation provenance.

Last updated: 2026-06-30.

## ✅ Done (this session)

- [x] **Plan view redesign** — removed debug dump; stats chips, consulate/penalty banners,
      phase grouping, severity emphasis (`app/plan.tsx`).
- [x] **Catalog expansion** — mined 15 webinars (5 Opus agents); catalog 20 → **54** obligations.
- [x] **Grounding pass** — verified new obligations against transcripts; stripped invented
      precision; pulled 4 ungrounded → `core/OBLIGATIONS_BACKLOG.md`.
- [x] **Provenance field** — required `source: 'webinar' | 'domain' | 'official'` on every
      obligation (`Obligation` + `Objective`, threaded through `buildPlan`).
- [x] **Anchor dates** — added `arrival_date` slot (type `date`) + live LLM parsing; engine
      now emits firm dates for arrival-anchored items and estimates `residency_established`
      from arrival; `estimated` flag is now honest. Verified end-to-end on 3 personas.
- [x] **Obligation detail drawers** — tap a plan card → modal with severity/category/source
      chips, timing explanation, prerequisites, and a provenance note (`app/plan.tsx`).
- [x] **Sourcing queue** — researched all 14 `domain` obligations against official sources;
      **flipped all 14 → `official`**; logged in `core/SOURCING.md`. Two real errors fixed:
      Modelo 720 "150% penalty" (struck down 2022) and Modelo 037 (abolished 2025).
- [x] **Live end-to-end test** — real Haiku extraction verified on 8 cases incl. new slots
      (arrival_date / owns_property_in_spain / has_pets), all correct; engine plan generation
      verified for NLV / DNV / EU personas.
- [x] **Audited the original 21 obligations** — promoted **10 → `official`** (with corrections),
      left 7 as `webinar` (generic process / soft estimates), 3 already done. Catalog source mix
      is now **29 `webinar` / 25 `official`**. Fixed a real bug: `family-reunification` was timed
      at residencia+30d → now ~1 year of residence. Also corrected the `medical-certificate`
      apostille mislabel, the criminal-check framing, the school-enrollment window, and added the
      6-month driving-licence limit. All logged in `core/SOURCING.md`.

## ✅ Done (follow-up session, 2026-06-30)

- [x] **Promoted `autonomo-social-security`** `webinar` → `official` (~€87–88 tarifa plana;
      logged in SOURCING.md). Catalog mix now **28 `webinar` / 26 `official`** (0 `domain`).
- [x] **Gated `tarjeta-sanitaria` off the NLV path** — `applies_if` now excludes
      `visa_type === 'nlv'` (NLV holders carry private cover, no public card on arrival).
      Title rewritten to explain the condition.
- [x] **`property_purchase` anchor** — added a `property_purchase` date slot (required when
      `owns_property_in_spain`), wired `anchorDate('property_purchase')` to read it. The notary /
      registry / transfer-tax items now resolve to firm dates instead of `pending_anchor`.
- [x] **Source tag on plan cards** — small coloured dot + short label (official / webinar /
      unverified) in each card's meta row, alongside the full chip in the detail drawer.
- [x] **Fixed the `ExternalLink.tsx` `tsc` error** — cast `href` to `Href`. `tsc --noEmit`
      is now fully green.
- [x] **Conversation-aware interview** — `phraseQuestion` + `extractAnswer` now receive the full
      transcript. Lola stops greeting on every turn ("Hey!"/"Hola!"), asks natural follow-ups,
      reuses context (mentioning a "wife" → the spouse question becomes a confirmation), and the
      extractor infers downstream values from earlier answers. Verified live.
- [x] **Clarify reprompt no longer leaks internals** — an unparseable answer now re-asks in Lola's
      voice via the friendly static question, instead of surfacing the extractor's raw "…you'd like
      me to extract?" string (`app/interview.tsx`).
- [x] **Living roadmap — foundation** (deterministic, invariant-safe). Per-obligation `progress`
      stored on the profile; engine reads it. "Action taken" section in the plan drawer: mark done
      (today) or **done on a specific date**. Done items render olive with a ✓ badge and a
      "Completed DATE · N days late/early" line; a "done" stat chip appears. **The living part:**
      a real completion date re-anchors downstream `relative_to_obligation` steps to the actual
      date (firm, not estimated) — verified live (empadronamiento filed 20 days late → tarjeta &
      Modelo 030 re-flowed from 14 Apr est. → 4 May firm). No LLM in the engine; the plan stays a
      pure function of the profile. (`core/engine-controller.ts`, `app/plan.tsx`)

## ✅ Done (living roadmap — layer 2)

- [x] **Living roadmap — layer 2 (the LLM half).** The plan drawer's "Something changed?" box now
      takes free text ("we had a baby", "we decided to rent instead of buy"); a Haiku Extractor maps
      it to a **profile-field delta** (fields derived from `SLOTS`, so it can't drift), then
      `derive()` + `buildPlan()` re-run and an amber Lola banner narrates a **deterministic diff**
      (added / removed / shifted, computed from before/after plans — Lola never invents the facts).
      The model emits typed profile values only; the engine still authors every obligation/date.
      Verified live: "we had a baby" → `has_children=true` → school-enrolment step added (38→39).

## ✅ Done (desktop interview polish + dictation)

- [x] **Tightened, centered interview for desktop** — chat is a centered ~640px column; the
      composer now sits **directly below the conversation** (not pinned to the viewport bottom),
      in a rounded pill. Landing copy/dev panel constrained too (`app/interview.tsx`).
- [x] **Progress bar + time estimate** — thin olive bar under the nav: "Question N of ~M" +
      "About X min left". `interviewProgress()` in the controller; clamped monotonic so the bar
      never goes backwards when a branch opens.
- [x] **Microphone dictation** — Web Speech API mic button in the composer (web/Chrome; hidden where
      unsupported). Tap to dictate into the answer field. Verified the button renders; live
      dictation needs the user's mic-permission grant.
- [x] **Celebratory "plan remodelled" modal** — replaced the inline banner with a centered amber
      popup ("That was useful — I've remodelled your plan!" + the deterministic diff). Verified live:
      "we'll rent instead of buy" → removed 6 property steps (38 → 32) (`app/plan.tsx`).
- [x] **Chat-first task drawer redesign** — rebuilt the messy detail sheet around a **context-aware
      Lola coach**: on open she explains how to tackle the step (plain text, defers specifics to a
      gestor — invariant 3), and the user can ask threaded follow-ups (`askLola` in `app/plan.tsx`).
      Cluttered sections replaced with compact pills + a compact action row (the full-width "I've
      done this" button is now a small "✓ Mark done" chip; "on a date"/"Details" are links; details
      collapse). Verified live incl. follow-up Q&A. Note: this is a 3rd LLM surface (advisory only,
      never authors plan data) — flag for the invariants review.

## ✅ Done (roadmap width + nav)

- [x] **Centered the roadmap on desktop** — `plan.tsx` content is now a max-width 820px column
      (`alignSelf: center`), matching the interview's centered layout. Stats chips kept.
- [x] **Added a "Home" nav link** to the left of "How it works" (`components/NavBar.tsx`), routing
      to `/` for a clean way back to the start.
- [x] **Capped the task sheet width on desktop** — the detail drawer now maxes at 640px and centers
      (`modalBackdrop` alignItems center + `sheet` maxWidth/alignSelf), instead of spanning full width.

## 🔜 Next (candidates, not yet started)

- [ ] **Native dictation** — the mic uses the web SpeechRecognition API; wire `expo-speech-recognition`
      (or similar) for iOS/Android so the mic works off-web.
- [ ] **Re-anchor more anchors from actuals** — completing `empadronamiento`/`residencia` could feed
      `padron_done`/`residency_established`, so residency-relative items also go firm. Today only
      direct `relative_to_obligation` steps re-flow from a real completion date.
- [ ] **Capture `residency_established` as a known-later field** — let users update it post-move
      so residency-anchored items become firm instead of estimated. (Needs a post-move edit flow.)
- [ ] **Re-add backlog items once sourced** — `sworn-translation`, `convenio-especial`,
      `modelo-390`, `citizenship-jura` (see `core/OBLIGATIONS_BACKLOG.md`).
- [ ] **More webinars** (when available) — health insurance, schooling, banking detail — toward
      the ~100-obligation target.

## 🐞 Known issues

- _(none open — `tsc --noEmit` is green.)_

## Invariants (do not break — see ../camino/CLAUDE.md)

1. Engine is deterministic — no LLM in plan-building.
2. Interview is derived from the catalog (every `applies_if` field has a slot or derivation).
3. Lola never invents deadlines/costs/laws — hence the `source` field + SOURCING.md.
4. The plan is a pure function of the profile.
