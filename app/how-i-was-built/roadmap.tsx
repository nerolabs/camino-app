// The product roadmap — the outward-facing twin of TODO.md's "Product roadmap" section.
// Public since 3 Jul 2026 (user decision): linked from the nav menu and in the sitemap; companion
// to the build story (how it got here) and the build log (the receipts).
//
// ⚠️ MAINTENANCE CONTRACT: update this page AND /how-i-was-built/log with EVERY PR, so what we
// tell users matches what we actually shipped. Source of truth is TODO.md's roadmap section —
// this page is its user-readable rendering (no internal jargon, honest about what we're NOT
// building and why).

    items: [
      { title: 'A "My account" page + a freshness robot', date: '13 Jul 2026', note: 'Email preferences (weekly roundup on/off), language, and delete now live in one account page instead of scattered across the menu. The interview\'s arrival question got tap-to-answer timeframe chips (a specific month still works too). And a monthly automated check flags any official figure that\'s gone stale or any government source link that stops resolving — so the "last verified" dates stay true, not decorative.' },
      { title: 'The pre-launch trust review — every fix shipped', date: '13 Jul 2026', note: 'Five independent reviewers went over the whole product with fresh eyes, and the full fix queue is now cleared. Lola can no longer praise an income the plan is about to flag or brush off a personal-case question; her first bubble discloses she\'s an AI. The AI endpoint got a human-check (Cloudflare Turnstile) and a budget alarm. Penalty steps like Modelo 720 are kept ("may apply") when you\'d rather not say, instead of silently dropping. Share links keep your answers off our servers. The legal figures live in one tested registry, the income threshold counts your real dependents, the privacy policy spells out lawful bases and retention, and the home page shows a real cited step instead of abstract badges.' },
      { title: 'The engine audit — and 13 new steps from it', date: '13 Jul 2026', note: 'A full one-night audit of every rule in the catalog, triggered by real family testing: fifteen findings fixed (Spanish passports offered the foreigner registration, job seekers routed to the no-work visa, short stays handed the full visa roadmap — all gone), plus nine new officially-sourced steps including the work and student routes and the one-year citizenship fast-track for spouses of Spanish citizens. The catalog is now 73 steps, every regional tax figure on the map is verified — foral territories included — and the licence-exchange country list matches the DGT\'s own table.' },
      { title: 'A public changelog — and every step says when it was last checked', date: '12 Jul 2026', note: 'Rules change; we say so. Every correction to the catalog is now on a public, dated changelog, and every step and guide carries a "last verified" date linking to it. The first regional entry came from the same day\'s verification pass: Valencia cut its property transfer tax to 9% in June — most of the internet still says 10%.' },
      { title: 'Share your roadmap — and meet four sample lives', date: '12 Jul 2026', note: 'A Share button now makes a read-only link to your roadmap (it encodes your answers, never your notes — the dialog says so plainly). And the sample plan became four: US retirees, a German family on the visa-free EU path, a Canadian digital nomad, and a British couple who already own a home in Andalucía — each a real engine run, not a brochure.' },
      { title: 'Real regional rates, verified at the source', date: '12 Jul 2026', note: 'The roadmap now shows the actual transfer-tax rate for Andalucía, Madrid, Cataluña, and Valencia, and the wealth-tax reliefs for Madrid and Andalucía — each figure checked the same day on that region\'s own tax portal, with the source linked next to it. Regions we haven\'t verified yet simply don\'t show a figure — no secondhand numbers.' },
      { title: 'Your last note shapes your roadmap — and “simpler” is said out loud', date: '12 Jul 2026', note: 'The interview\'s final "anything else I should know?" is now read for real facts — mention the dog and the pet steps appear immediately. Answers that remove steps say so ("−5 steps — simpler for you") instead of shrinking the roadmap silently. Also: the consulate step no longer quotes US wait times to everyone (they vary widely by consulate — check yours), and the privacy page says more precisely what our analytics contain.' },
      { title: 'A quieter Lola, a calmer finish, and a contact page', date: '11 Jul 2026', note: 'Lola\'s spoken voice is retired — it never fit the fast tap-through interview — though you can still dictate answers by microphone. The interview now ends properly: your last note is acknowledged, then a short countdown hands over to your roadmap instead of an abrupt jump. And "report a problem" grew into a real contact page — questions, feedback, or reports, one form, linked from every footer.' },
      { title: 'Lola gets her charm back', date: '10 Jul 2026', note: 'A same-night fix batch from an evening of family testing: Lola\'s reactions can see the whole conversation again — so she notices when the dog is coming too — while still never stating a fact or number outside your sourced roadmap. Arriving from a guide page is greeted by name again, the first question opens with the move itself, voice became opt-in, and the roadmap sheet ducked out from under the iPhone\'s Dynamic Island.' },
      { title: 'One homepage that shows the product working', date: '10 Jul 2026', note: 'Home and "how it works" merged into a single scrolling story: the Spain postcard up top, then a live loop of a roadmap building itself as questions get answered, a real sample as proof — 100% free, no catch — and the honesty pledge. Four homepage philosophies were prototyped and walked side by side; the warmest one won.' },
      { title: 'The interview builds your roadmap live', date: '10 Jul 2026', note: 'Answers are taps now, every question explains why it\'s asked, and your roadmap grows on screen while you talk to Lola — steps appearing, already dated, as each answer lands. Leave halfway and your progress waits for you. Born from watching the first real users: the data said the interview was the wall, so the interview became the product.' },
      { title: 'An honest income check', date: '10 Jul 2026', note: 'If your answers suggest your income can\'t reach a visa route\'s requirement, the roadmap now says so early — and conservatively, only when even the top of your range falls short — so you find out at the planning stage, not at the consulate.' },
      { title: 'Five languages, now on the iPhone too', date: '5 Jul 2026', note: 'A day after the web learned five languages, the iOS app caught up: a new TestFlight build carries the full localization and the mid-interview language switch onto the phone, verified on a real device. It shipped the disciplined way — the native user-flow tests had to pass before a single build was cut.' },
      { title: 'Saved roadmaps that actually save', date: '5 Jul 2026', note: 'A database permission change had quietly stopped signed-in roadmaps from persisting — and the failure was being swallowed, so it hid for days. Fixed on the live databases, verified end to end, and any future save failure now raises an alarm instead of vanishing. If you sign in, your roadmap is safe on every device again.' },
      { title: 'Cinco idiomas en un día', date: '5 Jul 2026', note: 'The whole experience now ships in five languages — English, Español, Français, Deutsch, Italiano. Lola interviews in yours, all sixty steps and guides read natively, emails and the printable roadmap follow your language, and each language meets its own sample couple. The web has real per-language pages for search engines, and your language choice follows you from browser to inbox.' },
      { title: 'The tests got a fresh-eyes audit', date: '5 Jul 2026', note: 'Before translating anything, every safety net was re-checked against reality: ten critical user journeys got honest coverage verdicts, the interview proved it already understands Spanish answers, and every email and the printable report are now snapshot-frozen so a translation can\'t quietly break them.' },
      { title: 'A safer name: Get Camino', date: '4 Jul 2026', note: 'The app and site now go by Get Camino — a distinctive compound matching the domain we already own, chosen deliberately before any brand spend on a crowded word.' },
      { title: 'Voice that takes turns', date: '4 Jul 2026', note: 'Opening the mic stops Lola mid-sentence; closing it keeps your last words; the cue appears when the mic is actually hot; the answer box grows as you dictate; and no spinner is allowed to live past 35 seconds — Lola owns the retry.' },
      { title: 'The app tests itself now', date: '4 Jul 2026', note: 'Twelve automated web journeys — including signing in and reworking a real roadmap — plus iOS simulator flows on every release train. The first run caught a bug on every page load that humans had scrolled straight past.' },
      { title: 'Every official source link, click-tested', date: '4 Jul 2026', note: 'All 55 government links checked against their steps; two were quietly broken (a retired portal, a cookie wall) and now point where they should.' },
      { title: 'Region-aware steps', date: '4 Jul 2026', note: 'The interview now asks which comunidad you\'re settling in, and the steps whose rules vary by region — transfer tax, wealth tax, school admissions, property tax — say so and name yours. Region-by-region rates come next as a sourced content pass.' },
      { title: 'Privacy, terms & delete-my-account', date: '4 Jul 2026', note: 'The grown-up pages: plain-language privacy policy and terms in every footer, cookieless analytics (no banner needed), and one-tap permanent account deletion in the menu.' },
      { title: 'Every guide got a written explainer', date: '4 Jul 2026', note: 'Sixty pages now tell you what each step actually is and how it feels in practice — with a build rule that the prose can never introduce a number the step itself doesn\'t carry.' },
      { title: 'Roadmap PDF export', date: '3 Jul 2026', note: 'One tap turns your roadmap into a clean printable report — estimated vs firm dates, official sources included. For the fridge door, or the gestor.' },
      { title: 'Report a problem', date: '3 Jul 2026', note: 'A quiet line in the menu, one text box, straight to us. Every report makes the roadmap better.' },
      { title: '“This week” view', date: '3 Jul 2026', note: 'One tap on your roadmap and you see just what needs your attention now — what’s slipped and what’s due in the next seven days. A clear week says so, honestly.' },
      { title: 'A free guide for every step', date: '3 Jul 2026', note: 'Sixty public pages — one per step in the catalog, each with when it’s due, why it matters, and the official source. The same facts your roadmap is built from, open to everyone.' },
      { title: 'One calmer nav everywhere', date: '3 Jul 2026', note: 'Desktop now matches mobile: browsing lives in the ☰ menu, the bar keeps just the actions.' },
      { title: 'The weekly roundup + welcome email', date: '3 Jul 2026', note: 'What’s overdue and what’s coming up, never more than a handful of tasks, each with a concrete tip. A welcome note when you join, one-click unsubscribe, and silence when there’s nothing pressing.' },
      { title: 'Passwordless email sign-in', date: '3 Jul 2026', note: 'A link (or one-time code) lands in your inbox and signs you in — no password to invent, works across devices.' },
      { title: '“Email me my roadmap”', date: '3 Jul 2026', note: 'One field on your fresh roadmap: saves it, creates your account silently, and the emailed link brings you back signed in.' },
      { title: 'Overdue tracking', date: '3 Jul 2026', note: 'Steps past their date now say so, in red — and Lola helps you re-flow the plan instead of letting it quietly rot.' },
      { title: 'Sample plan', date: '3 Jul 2026', note: 'See a real, full roadmap (Susan & Tom’s) before answering a single question.' },
      { title: 'Sign in with Apple + a cleaner sign-in dialog', date: '3 Jul 2026', note: 'One tap on iOS; Google everywhere.' },
      { title: 'iOS app in TestFlight', date: '1 Jul 2026', note: 'Full parity with the web: voice, dictation, the living roadmap.' },

    items: [
      { title: 'The iOS App Store submission', note: 'The build is in TestFlight, the paperwork is done, the screenshots are honest (retaken when a fresh-eyes pass caught one still showing a feature we\'d removed). Review takes as long as it takes — release stays manual, for a launch moment we choose. EU storefronts follow a pending trader-status declaration.' },
      { title: 'The languages get their human pass', note: 'Machine-drafted, mechanically linted — and now verified by native speakers, sentence by sentence, before launch. Corrections land as reviewable diffs against frozen snapshots.' },
