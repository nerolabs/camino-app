# Obligation sourcing log

Provenance for obligations marked `source: 'official'` in `engine-controller.ts`.
Verified 2026-06-30 via web research. Re-verify annually — several figures track IPREM
or the minimum wage (SMI) and change with the national budget.

> ⚠️ These were verified against official Spanish government portals
> (agenciatributaria.gob.es / AEAT, exteriores.gob.es, Instituto Cervantes) plus
> consistent corroboration across professional tax/immigration sources. Where only
> secondary sources were available, the fact was cross-checked across several.

## Corrections made during this pass (were wrong → now fixed)

- **`modelo-720`** — title previously said *"penalty up to 150% of asset value"*. That
  proportional penalty regime was **struck down by the CJEU on 27 Jan 2022** and replaced
  with flat-rate penalties (general regime: min €300). Threshold is €50,000 **per asset
  category** (accounts / securities / property), filed **1 Jan – 31 Mar**.
- **`register-autonomo`** — title previously listed *"Modelo 036/037"*. **Modelo 037 was
  abolished on 9 Feb 2025**; all altas now use Modelo 036. Order matters: 036 first, then
  RETA the same day or within 60 days.

## Original-catalog audit (the "Spain Visas 101" inheritance)

Re-verified the 21 original obligations that carried inherited `source: 'webinar'`.
**10 promoted to `official`** (below); **7 left as `webinar`** (generic process steps / soft
estimates — not specific legal figures needing a cite: `choose-visa-type`,
`consulate-appointment` [US wait is variable], `nie`, `empadronamiento`, `tarjeta-sanitaria`,
`exit-tax-return`, `dnv-remote-work-proof`); 3 were already verified in the prior pass.

### Corrections made

- **`family-reunification`** — timing was modeled at **residencia + 30 days**, which is wrong:
  reagrupación needs **~1 year of legal residence with a renewed permit**. Re-anchored to
  `residency_established + 365`. Added housing-report + means (≈150% IPREM + 50%/extra).
- **`medical-certificate`** — dropped "apostilled". Apostille is confirmed for the criminal
  check and civil records, **not** a private doctor's certificate; it needs issuing within
  90 days + Spanish translation.
- **`criminal-background-check`** — reframed around the real constraint: issued within 90 days,
  apostilled + translated (US channeler speeds the FBI report; "8–12 weeks" was imprecise).
- **`escolarizacion`** — window corrected from "Feb–Apr" to spring **≈March–May**, plus the
  "fuera de plazo" off-cycle route.
- **`dgt-exchange`** — added the **6-month** validity-after-residency limit and "medical check".
- **`residencia`** — clarified the 30-day rule is to **start** the TIE process, not receive the card.

## Still flagged for caution

- Region-specific figures (wealth-tax thresholds, ITP rate, IBI rate/month) genuinely
  vary by autonomous community / municipality. Titles say so rather than asserting one number.

## Catalog source mix

**Current (2026-07-02, after the B10 grounding pass): 52 `official` / 6 `webinar` / 1 `domain`.**
(Historical note: an earlier milestone read 28 `webinar` / 26 `official` after promoting
`autonomo-social-security`.)

## B10 grounding pass — 9 promoted `webinar` → `official` (2026-07-02)

Researched each remaining webinar obligation against official Spanish sources and promoted the
9 that map to a citable statutory/procedural rule; corrected details in the title where the
webinar draft was imprecise:

- **`community-fees`** → BOE, Ley 49/1960 de Propiedad Horizontal, art. 9(1)(e) (statutory duty of
  every owner to pay comunidad fees). `https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1960-10906`
- **`completion-deed-notary`** → administración.gob.es (Notarías y Registros). The notarial
  *escritura pública* is the standard legal formalisation of the sale; mandatory with a mortgage.
- **`land-registry-registration`** → same admin.gob.es page. **Correction:** registration is
  **voluntary** in Spain (mandatory only with a mortgage) → severity `required` → **`recommended`**,
  title now says "technically voluntary… but strongly recommended (court-protected title)".
- **`apostille-documents`** → Ministerio de Justicia, Legalización única / Apostilla de la Haya
  (1961 Hague Convention). Nuance added: each document is apostilled **in its issuing country**.
- **`nlv-renewal`** → Min. de Inclusión, "Hoja 7". **Correction:** window is **60 days before
  expiry → up to 90 days after** (late = minor infraction, fine ≤ €500), not just "60 days before".
- **`dnv-renewal`** → Min. de Inclusión / UGE-CE, Startups Law (Ley 28/2022): renewable for 2-year
  periods while qualifying conditions hold.
- **`student-visa-health-insurance`** → national student-visa requirement (exteriores): insurer
  authorised in Spain, SNS-equivalent cover, no copays/waiting, repatriation. Promoted to
  `official`; no clean canonical URL attached (documented here instead — same pattern as
  `nlv-health-insurance`).
- **`nlv-letter-of-intent`** and **`nlv-non-work-declaration`** → Min. de Inclusión, "Hoja 6"
  (initial NLV authorisation requirements). `…/w/autorizacion-inicial-de-residencia-temporal-no-lucrativa`

**Left as `webinar` on purpose (6)** — these are recommendations or practical steps, not Spanish
statutory obligations, so there is no `.gob.es` law to cite: `choose-visa-type` (orientation),
`consulate-appointment` (the "8–16 weeks" lead time is a soft, country-specific estimate),
`exit-tax-return` (depends on the *home* country's tax authority), `tax-planning-consultation`
(professional advice), `spanish-bank-account` (practical, not a legal duty),
`property-legal-due-diligence` (recommended professional advice). Honest to keep them flagged
`webinar` rather than dress them up as official.

## `tarjeta-sanitaria` applicability (2026-06-30)

Gated off the NLV path: NLV holders are required to carry private health insurance and are
**not** entitled to the public health card (tarjeta sanitaria) on arrival. The obligation now
applies to anyone with a Spanish address **except** `visa_type === 'nlv'`. Still `source:
'webinar'` — the gating is a process correction, not a new citable figure.

## `scout-where-to-live` — advisory obligation (2026-07-02)

New obligation recommending a **scouting trip** and a framework for **choosing where to live**
(cost of living, healthcare access, climate, transport, expat/English support, schools). Kept as
`source: 'domain'` deliberately: it asserts **no deadlines, costs, or laws** — only evaluation
*dimensions* — so it does not require an official citation and stays within invariant 3. Shown to
anyone who does not already `owns_property_in_spain`. This reintroduces a single `domain` item to
the catalog by design (advisory, not a citable fact); the audit queue for *factual* claims is
still empty. Catalog now **29 `webinar` / 26 `official` / 1 `domain`**.

## B10 — webinar → official promotion pass (2026-07-02, batch 1)

Researching webinar-sourced obligations against official sources and flipping to `source: 'official'`
with a canonical `source_url` (surfaced as a "View the official source" link in the roadmap).
Corrections noted. Also added `webinar_url` (staff-only) to keep the original YouTube for
cross-checking (URLs TBD — need per-obligation mapping from the user).

| id | official source | note / correction |
|---|---|---|
| `digital-certificate` | sede.fnmt.gob.es/certificados/persona-fisica | FNMT is the issuer; free for any DNI/NIE holder. |
| `beckham-law` | sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es …/regimen-especial.html | **Corrected:** 24% flat up to €600k for 6 yrs; since 2023 also covers remote workers/entrepreneurs (was "employed only"); usually not standard autónomos; election via Modelo 149 within ~6 months. |
| `empadronamiento` | administracion.gob.es …/detalleTramite idT=32988 | Managed by each ayuntamiento. |
| `citizenship-application` | mjusticia.gob.es/es/ciudadania/tramites/nacionalidad-residencia | Ministry of Justice online (Modelo 790 fee). |
| `permanent-residence` | administracion.gob.es …/residencia-permanente.html | 5 yrs continuous legal residence (absence limits apply). |
| `property-transfer-tax` | (regional — set per CCAA, no single national page) | **Corrected:** range 6–11% (was 7–10%); rate set by each autonomous community. `source_url` omitted (regional). |

Source mix after batch 1: **32 official / 22 webinar / 1 domain**. Remaining webinar items to work
through in later batches: nie, apostille-documents, consulate-appointment (soft estimate — may stay
webinar), NLV/DNV docs + renewals, tarjeta-sanitaria, spanish-bank-account, pet-import, student-visa
insurance, property (due diligence/notary/registry/community fees), tax-planning-consultation +
exit-tax-return (advisory — likely reclassify, not "official").

## B10 batch 2 (2026-07-02) — 7 more promoted

| id | official source | note / correction |
|---|---|---|
| `nie` | policia.es/_es/extranjeria_extranjeros.php | Form EX-15; Policía Nacional / Oficina de Extranjería. |
| `tarjeta-sanitaria` | sanidad.gob.es …/tarjetaSanitariaSNS/home.htm | Issued by the CCAA once healthcare right is recognised. |
| `pet-import` | mapa.gob.es …/viajar-perros-gatos-hurones | **Corrected:** rabies valid ≥21 days after 1st dose; from a non-EU country (US) an EU animal health certificate within 10 days of entry (intra-EU uses an EU pet passport). |
| `dnv-remote-work-proof` · `dnv-qualification-proof` · `dnv-company-activity-proof` · `dnv-employer-permission-letter` | inclusion.gob.es …/unidadgrandesempresas/teletrabajadores | UGE Teletrabajadores (Ley 14/2013 as amended by Ley 28/2022). |

Source mix after batch 2: **39 official / 15 webinar / 1 domain**. Remaining webinar (15) are mostly
soft estimates / advisory / process items to work through or reclassify next.

Webinar YouTube corpus captured in `docs/webinar-sources.md` (16 videos); no per-obligation mapping
yet — needed to populate the staff-only `webinar_url`.

## Webinar → obligation mapping (2026-07-02, batch 1)

Re-unpacked the transcripts (yt-dlp + Chrome cookies). Got 4/16 videos before YouTube throttled
(intermittent — the rest are fetchable incrementally). Titles recovered:
- 8zyT1TG9S5E — "Buying a Home in Spain"
- 2A19YnqiO4g — "Mistakes Americans Make in Spain"
- 9RUa0LsfFCQ — "Living in Madrid"
- C_UxMIqTd0Q — "Living in Malaga"

**Mapped (batch 1):** the property-purchase obligations → "Buying a Home in Spain" (8zyT), with
timestamps found in the transcript (bank account 3:11, community fees 3:37, notary 4:43):
`spanish-bank-account`, `community-fees`, `completion-deed-notary`, `property-legal-due-diligence`,
`land-registry-registration`, and `property-transfer-tax` (kept as **supplementary** — it already
has an official `source_url`, per user: webinar stays even when official). `webinar_url` is
staff-only for now.

Remaining: fetch the other 12 transcripts incrementally, read for accurate per-obligation
attribution + timestamps, and populate the rest.

## Webinar → obligation mapping (2026-07-02, batch 2 — all 16 transcripts captured)

The throttle reset and **all 16 transcripts** are now cached. Full title set:
Buying a Home (8zyT), Mistakes Americans Make (2A19), Living in Madrid (9RUa), Malaga (C_UxMIqTd0Q),
Spain Taxes 101 (HP55), Living in Catalonia (NwecXut5e24), Healthcare & Insurance (OnLKyPbpALY),
Digital Nomad Visa (SqmxlLuJ_bY), Retiring in Spain (U6_AOU1JdAE), Living in Valencia (b1E-RQIdv4A),
Cost of Living (gEY3Xkqs6so), How to Move to Spain – Key Steps (gtruvbQhphE), Renting (tQvPYhH99Nw),
Non-Lucrative Visa (tZJk56EH1ms), Spain Visas 101 (uH927kx3igU), Citizenship 101 (vAeqa_xdrTY).

Mapped **37 more obligations** to their topic-dedicated webinar with transcript-verified timestamps
(all **supplementary** / staff-only, kept even where an official `source_url` exists):
- **Admin/tax (Spain Taxes 101, HP55):** empadronamiento*, nie* (via Malaga C_UxMIqTd0Q), beckham-law,
  autonomo-social-security, register-autonomo, wealth-tax, modelo-720, exit-tax-return,
  tax-planning-consultation.
- **Visas 101 (uH927kx3igU):** choose-visa-type, consulate-appointment, criminal-background-check,
  medical-certificate, apostille-documents.
- **DNV (SqmxlLuJ_bY):** dnv-remote-work-proof, dnv-income-proof, dnv-coverage-certificate,
  dnv-employer-permission-letter, dnv-company-activity-proof, dnv-qualification-proof, dnv-renewal.
- **NLV (tZJk56EH1ms):** nlv-income-proof, nlv-health-insurance, nlv-letter-of-intent,
  nlv-non-work-declaration, nlv-renewal.
- **Healthcare (OnLKyPbpALY):** tarjeta-sanitaria, student-visa-health-insurance.
- **Citizenship 101 (vAeqa_xdrTY):** citizenship-track-standard, citizenship-track-latam,
  citizenship-application, dele-a2-exam, ccse-exam.
- **Regional/misc:** scout-where-to-live (Cost of Living gEY3Xkqs6so), dgt-exchange + dgt-exam
  (Mistakes 2A19), pet-import (Retiring U6).

Total: **43/55 obligations** now carry a supplementary `webinar_url`. The 12 left unmapped are
tax-form technicalities (modelo-030/100/130/303/200, ibi-property-tax, nonresident-property-tax) and
admin items (residencia, digital-certificate, escolarizacion, family-reunification,
permanent-residence) that the webinars don't cover with enough specificity to cite honestly.

## Backlog re-add — 4 obligations restored with official sources (2026-07-02)

The four obligations pulled to `OBLIGATIONS_BACKLOG.md` on 2026-06-30 (unverified domain knowledge)
were each verified against an official `.gob.es` source and re-added to the live catalog as
`source: 'official'` with a `source_url`. Catalog grows **55 → 59** (44 official / 15 webinar).

- **`sworn-translation`** — MAEC:
  `https://www.exteriores.gob.es/es/ServiciosAlCiudadano/Paginas/Traductores-Interpretes-Jurados.aspx`.
  Verified: foreign↔Spanish translations are official only if by a MAEC-appointed *traductor jurado*.
  Depends on `apostille-documents`.
- **`convenio-especial`** — Ministerio de Sanidad:
  `https://www.sanidad.gob.es/servCiudadanos/internacional/convenioEspecial.htm`.
  Verified figures added to the title: ≥1 year continuous residence + empadronamiento; monthly
  premium **€60 (<65) / €157 (65+)** (Orden TAS/2865/2003). NLV-scoped.
- **`modelo-390`** — AEAT:
  `https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/iva/modelo-390-iva-declaracion-resumen-anual.html`.
  Verified: informative annual VAT recap of the year's Modelo 303, filed in the **first 30 days of
  January**, electronic only. `severity: penalty`, depends on `modelo-303`.
- **`citizenship-jura`** — Ministerio de Justicia:
  `https://www.mjusticia.gob.es/es/ciudadania/tramites/nacionalidad-residencia`.
  Correction: the jura/promesa (art. 23 Código Civil) must be done **within 180 days of the grant
  notification** or the concession lapses (caducidad) — title now states this. Depends on
  `citizenship-application`.

All four verified present in `buildPlan` output for a NON-EU NLV self-employed profile (phases:
before_you_go / when_settled / ongoing / when_settled respectively) — no dependency cycles.
